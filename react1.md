# 1. React - What and Why

## What is React?

* A library which helps you to build the View for your Javascript application. Using React, your UI will be rendered by a set of components.

* For example, you can write a Button component to render your button, a NavigationBar component to render your navigation bar, or a HomePage component which contains your Button and NavigationBar.

## Why components?

* The UI separated by components will help our code easier to maintain and reason about. 
* Each component can be resused in many modules or projects. 
* Many published components create a rich React ecosystem.

## Why React?

* To build the UI with separation of concern and high reusability.
* Take advantage of its rich ecosystem.
* To combine it with great architecture (Flux, Readux, ...) and many useful libraries
* Not only to build web app but also mobile app with React Native (learn once write everywhere)
